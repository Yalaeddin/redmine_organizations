# Redmine organizations plugin

This plugin aims at providing a nested organization structure for Redmine users.
It will help manage Redmine instances in big organizations.

/!\ USE IT ONLY WITH A FRESH REDMINE INSTALL! Transition from standard users or groups memberships is not implemented yet, and you can loose data if you use the plugin with existing project memberships.
